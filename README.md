# FFB6D Container

Welcome to the FFB6D Container repository! This repository contains a Docker container for the FFB6D tool, a program for simulating and analyzing the behavior of complex systems developed by the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

## Getting Started

To use this container, you'll need to have Docker installed on your system. If you don't have Docker installed, you can download it from the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

Once you have Docker installed, you can build the container using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t ffb6d-container .
```

This command will build the container using the Dockerfile in this repository and tag it with the name `ffb6d-container`.

## Running the Container

After building the container, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ffb6d-container
```

This command will start the container in interactive mode (`-it`) and remove the container when it's done running (`--rm`). Once the container is running, you can use FFB6D by following the instructions in the FFB6D documentation, which is available in the container at `/usr/local/ffb6d/README.txt`.

## About the Container

This container is based on Ubuntu 16.04 and includes all the necessary dependencies for running FFB6D. The container also includes a copy of the FFB6D source code, which is installed in `/usr/local/ffb6d`.

If you have any issues with the container, please feel free to open an issue in the repository.

## Conclusion

Thank you for using the FFB6D Container! We hope this container makes it easy for you to use the FFB6D tool in your projects. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to let us know. Happy coding!
